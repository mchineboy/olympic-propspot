# 🎭 Olympic PropSpot: Theatrical Asset Management Extravaganza! 🎪

Welcome to the most dramatic, spectacular, and downright theatrical asset management system this side of Broadway! 🌟

## 🎟️ What's This Show All About?

Olympic PropSpot is the ultimate backstage pass to managing your theatrical props, costumes, and sets. It's like having a personal stage manager for all your theatrical assets! 

### 🌟 Star-Studded Features:

- 🔐 Secure user authentication (because we can't have just anyone accessing our precious props!)
- 👑 Admin dashboard (for those who like to feel important)
- 📊 Asset tracking (no more lost mustaches or misplaced swords)
- 🎨 Beautiful, responsive UI (because even backstage should look good)

## 🚀 Getting This Show on the Road

### 🎬 Preproduction (Setup)

1. Clone this repo faster than a quick costume change:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/olympic-propspot.git
cd olympic-propspot
```

2. Install dependencies (it's like assembling your stage crew):

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your Firebase project (your virtual theater):

- Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
- Enable Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting
- Add a web app to your project and copy the config

4. Create a `.env` file and add your Firebase config:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### 🎭 Dress Rehearsal (Development)

Run the development server (it's showtime... almost):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and break a leg!

### 🎉 Opening Night (Deployment)

1. Build your project (like a final dress rehearsal):

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Install Firebase CLI (your backstage pass to deployment):

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

3. Login to Firebase (don your stage manager hat):

```bash
firebase login
```

4. Initialize your project (set the stage):

```bash
firebase init
```

5. Deploy your project (cue the curtain call):

```bash
firebase deploy
```

🎉 Bravo! Your show is now live on Firebase Hosting!
